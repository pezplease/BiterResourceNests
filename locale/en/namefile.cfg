[mod-setting-name]
resource-nests-starting-resource-exemption=Remove biter nests from starting zone resources.
resource-nests-remove-normal-nests=Remove all non-resource biter nests from the map.
resource-nests-add-resource-to-drop-table=Make Resource Biters Drop Resources
resource-nests-resource-drop-rate=Drop Rate For Resource Biters
resource-nests-resource-drop-amount=Amount Dropped Per Biter
resource-nests-nest-damage-taken-multiplier=Nest Damage Recieved Multiplier
resource-nests-destroy-all-starting-nests=Remove all nests around starting area.
resource-nests-biter-health-multiplier=Resource Biter Health Multiplier

[mod-setting-description]
resource-nests-starting-resource-exemption=Highly recommended to have on. Impossible to progress in vanilla otherwise.
resource-nests-remove-normal-nests=Remove all other biters and biter nests, making resource biters the only enemy type on Nuavis.
resource-nests-add-resource-to-drop-table=All resource biters will drop the ore they are made from.
resource-nests-resource-drop-rate=If Resource Drops are enabled, sets the chance a resource is dropped when a biter dies. One is a guarenteed drop.
resource-nests-resource-drop-amount=How much of the resource is dropped when a biter dies. Scales with the health of the biter. For example: setting it to 1 means that a small iron biter will drop 1 iron ore per drop, while a medium will drop 5 iron ore per drop. Drops cap at 25x base drop.
resource-nests-nest-damage-taken-multiplier=How much damage the nests take when sending out units. 1 is normal, 0.5 is half, 2 is double, etc. Putting this to 0 will let you farm the nests forever.
resource-nests-destroy-all-starting-nests=Use this if you have modded resources in your starting area that you need for early game progression.
resource-nests-biter-health-multiplier=Modifies the health of each resource biter
