This mod adds tough nests on top of each resource nest in the game that must be destroyed before the resource can be accessed. The nests lay dorment until you build too close to the nests or try to mine the resources, then it awakens and starts sending out biters and launching projectiles to tear down your defenses. Each nest has different attacks, health, damages and resistances, and different stratagies must be used to take each one out.
